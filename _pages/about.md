Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in the Earth System Science department at Stanford University. My advisor is [Paula Welander](https://welanderlab.stanford.edu/). My research explores the diversity and evolutionary history of terpenoid cyclases. You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mdmGCvAAAAAJ&hl=en).

During my graduate research, I have investigated the functional diversity of terpenoid cyclases, enzymes that biosynthesize polycyclic lipids such as sterols and hopanoids. I have also conducted theoretical work on the consequences of the effectiveness of selection for protein evolution. 

I previously studied Organismal Biology at Harvard University and researched the evolution of nitrogenase enzymes. I grew up in Durham, North Carolina. Outside the lab, I enjoy birdwatching.
