Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in the Earth System Science department at Stanford University. My advisor is **[Paula Welander](https://welanderlab.stanford.edu/)**. I am interested in the evolution of proteins and lipid membranes, with a focus on long timescales and evolutionary dynamics. You can find a list of my publications **[here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mdmGCvAAAAAJ&hl=en)**.

My graduate research has explored the diversity and evolutionary history of terpenoid cyclases, enzymes that biosynthesize polycyclic lipids such as sterols and hopanoids. I have also conducted theoretical work on the consequences of the effectiveness of selection for protein evolution. 

I previously studied Organismal Biology at Harvard University and researched the evolution of nitrogenase enzymes. I grew up in Durham, North Carolina. Outside the lab, I enjoy birdwatching, growing plants, and building aquaria.
