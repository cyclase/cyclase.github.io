Hello! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher working with **[Angela Phillips](https://aphillipslab.ucsf.edu/)** in the department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. I am interested in the evolution of protein biophysics, with a focus on long timescales and evolutionary dynamics. You can find a list of my publications **[here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mdmGCvAAAAAJ&hl=en)**, and a full CV **[here](https://cyclase.github.io/assets/pdf/McShea_CV.pdf)**.

I earned my PhD in 2024 working with **[Paula Welander](https://welanderlab.stanford.edu/)** at Stanford University. My doctoral research explored the functional diversity and evolutionary history of terpenoid cyclases, enzymes that biosynthesize polycyclic lipids such as sterols and hopanoids. I have also conducted theoretical work on the consequences of the effectiveness of selection for protein evolution. 

I previously studied Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University and researched the evolution of nitrogenase enzymes. I grew up in Durham, North Carolina. Outside the lab, I enjoy birdwatching, growing plants, and building aquaria.
